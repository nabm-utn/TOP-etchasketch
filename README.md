# Etch a Sketch
This is a project from the foundation path of *The Odin Project*!

## Objective
Build a webpage with a grid of divs that change color as you hover over them, simulating something alike to a whiteboard / sketchboard. 
These are some of the requirements:

        The divs must be in a grid of sorts.
        The divs must turn to black as you hover over them.
        There will be a button to reset the board.
        The ammount of divs in the board should be customizable. 

Let's see how it goes!
